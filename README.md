# Introduction

Janus is an authentication and authorization system with the following properties:

- **Provable**: It's always possible to prove the correctness of a statement made by the system.
- **Antifragile**: As load increases, the system becomes more robust.
- **Federated**: It's possible to federate multiple instances, thanks to 
its [capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) based model.
